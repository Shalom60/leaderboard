Users 
The Users page is a section of the web application which users check their points tally and the position they ranked according to the total points that they scored for. The users are also provided with a share functionality, so as their progress can be noted by others on the various social media platforms.
The admins section on the other hand, includes a sign-up, a login page and the admins leader board.
This helps the super admin to be able to sign-up new admins and the login page helps the super admin and the sub-admin, login in to the admin leader board. On the admins leader board is where the admins update the userâ€™s information as well as adding new admins to the leader board application
